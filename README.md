## Project Objectives:

### Your game should be playable by users. In order to facilitate this, build out the following behavior:

1. **When a user runs `main.js`, they should be prompted for input and be able to indicate which direction they’d like to “move”.**
2. **After entering an instruction, the user should see a printed result of their current field map with the tiles they have visited marked with `*`. They should be prompted for their next move.**

### This should continue until the user either:

1. **Wins by finding their hat.**
2. **Loses by landing on (and falling in) a hole.**
3. **Attempts to move “outside” the field.**
